My name is Taylor Coleman and I currently a part-time Data Science student at Lambda school.  I studdied biophysics & chemistry for a couple of years at ASU. I also have my real estate license and passed the SIE (securties industry estentials) exam.  When I graduate Lambda school I plan on using my data science skills in finance and real estate.
